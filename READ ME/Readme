## Overview
This is a static page that allows a user to sign up to a news letter. It requires the user to input his email and if incorrect email is inputed the app will react
### The challenge
In this app, Users should be able to:
- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
### Continued development
I feel more can be done in a real world senario in an app like this such as collecting the email the user inputted in order for the company or organisation to use.
